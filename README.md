# NBA Over/Under Prediction 

An NBA Over/Under prediction model built using machine learning techniques to predict a statistic of 
an NBA player based on past statistics and other game-related data. This project uses logistic regression to classify 
whether the player's target statistic in his next game will go over or under a given betting line. It is intended for sports analysts, bettors,
and anyone interested in analyzing NBA games.

## Getting Started 

**Prerequisites:** 
- Python 3.7+
- Java 21.x+ (if using the GUI)

**Installation:**
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/projectname.git` 
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd projectname`
3. Create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies: `python3 -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - For Linux/macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
   - For Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
5. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

### **Key Parameters**
1. **First Name**: The first name of the player (as found at https://www.nba.com/players)
2. **Last Name**: The last name of the player (as found at https://www.nba.com/players)
3. **Target Stat**: The statistical category you want to predict for (MIN, FGM, FGA, FG3M, FG3A, FTM, FTA, OREB, DREB, REB, AST, TOV, STL, BLK, PTS, PLUS_MINUS).
4. **Money Line**: The betting line (e.g., 25.5).

### **Through GUI**
1. Run the Java GUI application by executing the following command from the root project:
   - For Linux/macOS: `java -jar GUI/MoneyLinePredictor.jar`
   - For Windows: `java -jar GUI\MoneyLinePredictor.jar`
1. In the name box, enter the first name, a space, and the last name.
2. In the target stat box, enter the statistic.
3. In the money line box, enter the line.
4. Click the predict button.

### **Through Command Line**

Once the environment is set up and dependencies are installed, you can run the model using the `prediction_model.py` script. The script takes in **four parameters** to predict the over/under betting line for a given player's next game.

Hereâ€™s an example of running the model from the command line: `python3 Scripts/prediction_model.py LeBron James points 25.5`

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, here are a few things to check:
1. Ensure that you've activated the virtual environment and installed the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Ensure you're using Python 3.x. Verify the version by running `python --version`
3. Make sure you have Java 21.x+ installed for the GUI. If there are issues running the `.jar` file, try reinstalling Java.
